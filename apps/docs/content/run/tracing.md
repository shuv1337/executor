description: "Read a slow request as a waterfall. Executor bundles a local trace store and viewer, and exports OTLP to any collector you point it at instead."

When a request is slow, the useful question is which part was slow: building the
app, an account lookup, a stored-data query, or the upstream service answering.
Executor already produces spans for all of that. You only have to decide where
they go.

## The bundled collector

Local, desktop and self-host builds package [Motel](https://github.com/kitlangton/motel),
a small OTLP store and viewer over a SQLite file. It is the default destination,
so traces are being recorded already.

Where it writes depends on where you run:

| Deployment | Diagnostics directory                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local      | `<EXECUTOR_DATA_DIR>/diagnostics`, by default `.local/executor/diagnostics` |
| Self-host Docker | `EXECUTOR_MOTEL_DATA_DIR`, by default `/app/motel-data`              |

The local diagnostics directory holds:

- `collector.json` — the collector's state, process ID, query URL and database
  path.
- `motel/` — the stored traces and logs, as Motel's SQLite files.
- `executor-local.jsonl` or `executor-selfhost.jsonl` — Effect logs, written
  independently of the collector.

Motel keeps seven days and targets 1 GiB. Each log file keeps four rotated
archives at about 10 MiB each.

Motel runs in workerd. In self-host Docker it shares the product's workerd
process and keeps its SQLite files in the `motel` folder of
`EXECUTOR_MOTEL_DATA_DIR`. This directory must be separate from `/app/data`. Replacing the container discards telemetry by
default. Mount a separate volume at the Motel directory to retain it. The
container does not include Node or Bun.

Motel also stores the log records that Executor writes. A record written
during a request has the trace ID of that request. Executor does not write a
log record for each request, so most requests produce only a trace. Warnings,
errors, and app page requests produce log records. An empty `/api/logs/search`
result does not mean that log export is broken. The search covers the last
hour by default. Set `lookback`, for example `lookback=24h`, to search further
back. Each log record also goes to the container log.

The collector binds to container loopback on port 4318 and publishes no port.
For the container named `executor-v2` in the [self-host instructions](/run/self-host),
query it with a temporary container that shares its network:

```bash
docker run --rm --network container:executor-v2 curlimages/curl \
  --fail --silent --show-error 'http://127.0.0.1:4318/api/traces?limit=20'
```

The collector serves `/api/health`, `/api/traces`,
`/api/traces/<trace-id>/spans`, `/api/logs/search` and `/openapi.json`.

## Exporting to your own collector

Set an OTLP endpoint and Executor exports there instead. Any collector works:
the OpenTelemetry Collector, Grafana Alloy, Jaeger, or a hosted backend.

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector.local:4318
```

| Variable                              | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`         | Base URL for all three signals.                                            |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`  | Full traces URL. Overrides the base for traces.                            |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`    | Full logs URL.                                                             |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | Full metrics URL.                                                          |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`          | Headers for a collector that needs authentication. Use URL-encoded values. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS`   | Headers for traces only. The logs and metrics signals have their own.      |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL` | Set to `http/json` for a collector that does not accept protobuf metrics.  |
| `EXECUTOR_BUILD_VERSION`              | Identifies the build, normally the commit SHA.                             |
| `EXECUTOR_ENVIRONMENT`                | Identifies the deployment. Locally this defaults to `development`.         |

Traces and logs go out as OTLP over HTTP with a JSON payload. Metrics default to
OTLP protobuf.

For a hosted backend, put the credential in the headers:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://collector.example.com
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='authorization=Bearer%20<token>'
```

The self-host compose file passes every one of these through. An unset variable
stays absent, which keeps the bundled collector as the destination.

## Using Motel on your own machine

Motel runs standalone too. It needs [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and listens on port
`27686`.

```bash
bunx @kitlangton/motel
```

That starts ingest and opens the terminal viewer. For ingest without the viewer,
run `bunx @kitlangton/motel server`.

Point a server on the same machine at it:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:27686/v1/traces
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:27686/v1/logs
```

From a container, Motel is on the host and binds loopback by default, so it also
has to listen on an address the container can reach:

```bash
MOTEL_OTEL_HOST=0.0.0.0 bunx @kitlangton/motel server
```

`MOTEL_OTEL_HOST=0.0.0.0` exposes the trace store to your whole network. Traces
carry request URLs and timings, and logs carry more. Use it only on a network
you trust.

## Reading a trace

A single request is a set of spans, each indented under its parent, with the
time it held:

```text
http.server GET                        31ms
  executor.stack.http.resolve          28ms
    executor.stack.build               28ms
      executor.stack.scoped_executor   27ms
        executor.plugins.init          16ms
        executor.stack.create_executor  2ms
        executor.subject.touch          7ms
```

The indentation is where the answer is. Time held by `http.server` but not by
any child is time spent outside the instrumented code: the network in front of
the server, or a tunnel. Time inside one child tells you which phase to open
next.

A request that arrives with a `traceparent` header continues that trace instead
of starting a new one, so a call through a proxy keeps one trace ID end to end.

 * Cloud runs data steps inside the new Worker after it deploys. Schema migrations run earlier, in

 * source in Cloudflare Artifacts. The minute cron advances them from the SQL journal the schema
 * migration created, never from a request. An older Worker version does not know a new step, so
 * the first tick of the version that ships it starts it. A pass that leaves items to retry records
 * a backoff in the journal, so a step that keeps failing is not retried every minute.

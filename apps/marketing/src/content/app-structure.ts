# Give me a project brief

1. Ask which repository to review if it is not clear.
2. Use refreshBrief with the repository owner and name.
3. Wait for the workflow to finish, then call listBriefs.
4. Summarize the saved open issue count in plain language.

Mention which repository the brief covers.
If the refresh fails, say so instead of presenting old data as new.

Follow the user's instructions and Executor's approval requests.`,

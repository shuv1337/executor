## Deployment

Deploy your app as one project. Executor builds and hosts it, connects the accounts
it needs, and retains its source and deployment history. Change the code and deploy
again as your needs change.

## What you get

${capabilityLines.join("\n\n")}

## Accounts and approvals

Credentials are stored separately from app source. Executor supplies the selected
credentials to trusted app server code when it runs. OAuth refresh tokens and
client secrets remain with the host. Apps can require approval before a tool runs.

## Ways to run it

- **Cloud:** run your tools without managing a server. ${siteOrigin}/
- **Desktop:** run Executor on your computer, with local apps and private app pages.
- **CLI:** run the local server from your terminal.
- **Self-hosted:** run the hosted server on infrastructure you control.

Private app pages and saved app data work locally. Self-hosted supports private
app pages. Cloud app pages and hosted app data are still in development.

## Pricing

Start free, pay per member. Full details: ${siteOrigin}/pricing.md

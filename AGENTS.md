# Working on Executor

Before changing code, read:

1. [Coding style and engineering direction](notes/coding-style.md).
   This is Rhys's guidance for Effect, typed contracts, package layout, public
   SDK imports, sharing between products, UI, testing and collaboration.
2. [Project orientation](notes/project-orientation.md).
   This explains the goal, accepted model, product boundaries and current state.
3. [Deferred work](notes/deferred.md) when choosing what to build next.
   Parked ideas and historical experiments are not implementation instructions.

Apply that guidance across the whole change, including contracts and consumers.
New instructions from Rhys take precedence. Update these notes when a decision
changes instead of leaving conflicting instructions.

The key boundaries are Effect v4 inside the framework, Promise APIs for app
authors, and product-owned authorization. Share capabilities and typed views
without forcing hosted organizations into local. Use public SDK surfaces and
the existing shared UI. See the coding note for details and the pinned Effect
reference.

## Migrations must keep the app online

Cloud migrations run before the replacement server deploys. Every migration
must leave the currently deployed server able to serve requests. A later deploy
failure does not undo committed SQL; the old server must still work afterward.

Add schema first, deploy code that uses it, then remove obsolete fields in a
later release after no running code needs them. Never drop or rename a required
column before deploying its replacement. Do not install a maintenance Worker,
change production routes, or stop traffic to make a migration work. If an online
path is not available, stop and explain the blocker before changing production.

Only our own installs currently need upgrades. Use the supported current baseline
and preserve their data; do not keep obsolete upgrade paths for hypothetical
installs. Never reset data or relabel a schema version to bypass an upgrade.
Record completed steps, keep them immutable, and make repeat runs safe. Do not
replay backfills or rebuild constraints and triggers on every deploy. Bound lock
waits and review write blocking, including index builds.

Verify fresh setup, retained data, repeat runs, rollback/retry, and compatibility
with the running server before release. Use the real database adapter for each
affected product. See [storage migrations](notes/storage.md#current-baseline-and-migrations).

## Tests are E2E only

The only tests in this repository live in `e2e/`. Every test is an E2E scenario
that drives a real server through HTTP, MCP, the CLI or the browser. Unit tests
are banned: do not add `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, type tests, `test/` or
`__tests__/` directories anywhere else, including packages, scripts and helpers,
and do not import application implementations into tests. `bun run check` fails
on any test outside `e2e/`.

The one exception is the Go host in `apps/hosted/self-host/native`. Its
`go test` suite covers timing races between the host's proxy and workerd that a
real image cannot hit reliably, and CI runs it in the `self-host-native` job.

Tests are not sacred. Delete a scenario when it no longer proves behavior a user
or public API caller depends on, or when other scenarios already cover it. Say
what it covered and why that coverage is not needed. Deletion is not a fix for
a flaky scenario that still guards real behavior: find the race in the product
or the scenario instead.

## Checks

For application features, fixes, and behavior-preserving refactors, use the
[executor-e2e skill](.agents/skills/executor-e2e/SKILL.md).

Run only named scenarios that exercise the code you changed. Never run a full
suite (`e2e:self-host`, `e2e:local`, `e2e:cloud` or `e2e:deployed` without
`--test-name`); the PR's CI runs the full local suites, and post-merge Cloud
tests run the deployed suite. When a change is cross-cutting, pick one or two
scenarios per changed path and name them in the handoff. Investigate a failure
CI reports instead of re-running suites to look for one.

For authenticated testing and bug reproduction, use
[test accounts](notes/test-accounts.md). The fixture command provisions
synthetic users, organization roles and short-lived sessions for self-host,
cloud dev and running test stages. On production, agents sign in through real
email codes to `@agents.executor.engineering` inboxes. Keep session files
private and out of tool output.

Run `bun run format` before committing. `bun run check` runs the format check,
`oxlint`, and the typecheck; CI-style verification should use it. Lint rules
live in `.oxlintrc.jsonc`, formatter settings in `.oxfmtrc.json`.

The typecheck uses TypeScript 7 (`tsc` is the native Go compiler). `bun install`
patches it with `@effect/tsgo` in `prepare`, so it also reports the Effect
language service diagnostics configured in `tsconfig.json`. Effect errors fail
the typecheck; warnings mark rules with too many existing sites to fix at once.
TypeScript 7 has no JavaScript compiler API. The `packages/apps` build scripts
and `e2e/check-boundary.ts` import TypeScript 5.9 as `typescript-5` for it;
do not use that package to typecheck.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests, pushes to `main` and manual
dispatch. Its local checks use no secrets and include the emulated Cloud target.
An earlier PR run on the same ref is cancelled; `main` runs finish so every merge
has a baseline. The jobs live in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`,
a `workflow_call` workflow, so another repository can call the same jobs.

### Choosing a PR's E2E scenarios

A pull request runs only the E2E scenarios it selects. Pushes to `main` run the
full suite. The static checks (`check`, `apps-version`, `self-host-native`) always
run, except in a skipped stack layer. Put exactly one fenced `e2e` block in the PR
description, listing spec files from `e2e/tests/`:

````md
```e2e
groups.spec.ts
invitation-roles.spec.ts
```
````

Spec files the PR adds or changes are always included. Write `none` for a change
no scenario exercises, such as documentation. Write `all` for cross-cutting changes:
the e2e harness (`e2e/sdk`, `e2e/support`, `e2e/setup.ts`), the toolchain, lockfile or
workflows, shared runtime, storage or auth, or anything whose callers you cannot
enumerate. A description without the block runs the full suite. An unknown file name
fails the `select` job. [`e2e/ci-selection.ts`](e2e/ci-selection.ts) turns the block
into each job's scenario list; the run summary shows it.

In a stack, write `skip` in each lower layer's block, such as a code PR under its
tests PR. Every job in that run skips, the static checks included. The top layer
checks the combined change: its static checks run against the whole tree,
`apps-version` compares it with `main`, and its `e2e` block must select the
scenarios for every layer's changes. `skip` fails the `select` job unless another
open PR targets the layer's branch, so a lone PR or the top layer cannot skip.
After changing a lower layer, rebase the layers above it so the top runs again.
Merge the stack only when the top layer passes, bottom first, without pausing between
layers: each merge deploys production.

Choose from the actual callers of the changed code. Search `e2e/tests/` for the
routes, tools and UI the change touches, and include every file that exercises them
on any target. Too narrow a selection only defers the failure to `main`. The `select`
job reads the live description, so after editing it, rerun the whole workflow
(`gh run rerun <run-id>`), not only failed jobs.

A failure on `main` is a regression or a flake that a PR selection missed. Fixing
it takes priority over new work that touches the same area.

A PR run takes at most about seven minutes. Wait for it once; do not poll post-merge
suites before handing off. When a job fails in a scenario the change does not
touch:

- Compare with the latest `main` run: `gh run list -w CI -b main -L 3`.
- If `main` fails the same scenario, it is not yours. Name it in the handoff.
- Otherwise read the failure evidence before rerunning. Rerun a failed job at
  most once. A scenario that fails again, or fails on unrelated PRs, is a flake.
  Record the scenario, the run link and the error in the handoff and finish the
  task; fixing it is separate work that Rhys schedules.

A flake is a bug in the product or the scenario, not noise. Never add retries,
longer deadlines or skips to make a run pass.

`.github/workflows/cloud-tests.yml` runs deployed tests only after pushes to `main`.
It finishes the active run and coalesces pending pushes. Manual deployed jobs share
the same non-cancelling concurrency group. Each job owns a disposable Neon staging environment.
Scenarios retain 60-second deadlines. The job owns its teardown and evidence artifacts. These post-merge
checks are not required PR checks. Agents can run targeted deployments through
the same SDK and CLI on demand.

Every push to `main` deploys production directly, without a deployed-test gate.
The deployed suite remains available for manual dispatch with Neon or PlanetScale.

Blacksmith Linux runners run five check jobs. Local, self-host and Cloud E2E jobs use
`blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404`. The load job also uses 16 vCPUs: on 4 vCPUs the
product server, PGlite and the test driver contend. Its inventory case has a 120-second
test limit because its body takes 40-48s on CI. Static checks use 4 vCPUs.

Do not run CI checks on macOS runners. They cost 5-20x as much per minute as Linux
runners and were most of the CI bill, and no check needs macOS. Fix slow or flaky
scenarios on Linux instead of moving them to a Mac.

- `check` runs `bun run check`: the format check, `oxlint`, the typecheck, the
  no-tests-outside-`e2e/` check and the e2e boundary check.
  It also builds the public site and runs `bun run site:links`, which fails when
  any marketing or docs page links to a path that would 404.
- `select` runs [`e2e/ci-selection.ts`](e2e/ci-selection.ts) and gives each e2e job
  its `--test-name` pattern, or skips the job when none of its scenarios is selected.
  Its job patterns hold the exclusions and splits below.
- `e2e-local` and `e2e-self-host` run `bun run e2e:prepare`, then `e2e:local`
  and `e2e:self-host` under `xvfb-run`. The self-host run excludes the Claude
  Code MCP scenario, which needs a model API key that CI does not hold.
- `e2e-self-host-scale` runs the 1,000-account workload and then the 7,000-tool MCP
  catalog scenario and the slow and stalled tool listing scenarios on its own runner,
  in parallel with the functional jobs. This preserves the four concurrent writers,
  the catalog and listing latency bounds and the inventory case's 120-second limit without
  competing with the functional job's product servers.
- `e2e-cloud` runs Cloud onboarding, delivered observability, bearer refusal and billing polling
  scenarios; the refusal scenario writes stored rows into the runner-owned Postgres. It starts
  the local Cloud Worker, a throwaway Postgres container and the service emulators, so it needs
  Docker but no credentials.

Cloud scenarios verify
API/MCP outcomes, workflow correlation, browser failures, app traces and analytics.
Deployed tests run through `bun run e2e:deployed`; the runner owns provisioning
and teardown. The release workflow builds and tests Docker images on release PRs
and manual dispatch. Publication requires an explicit channel dispatch from main.
Release PRs build and test the Linux and Windows targets only. The macOS targets run
on manual dispatch, where they are built, signed, notarized and tested. macOS runners
cost 5-20x as much as Linux runners, so keep them off pull requests.

A failed e2e job uploads raw reports and server logs. Product database files,
runtime dependencies and private `actors.json` sessions are excluded.
Reports use Vitest's final result, including setup and cleanup failures.
Evidence rendering runs only on request.

`.github/actions/setup` pins Bun and Node and installs the workspace with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile`. Change toolchain versions there only.
`.github/actions/e2e-tools` installs Playwright Chromium, ffmpeg and Xvfb.
Validate workflow edits with `actionlint`.

## Workspace lifecycle

The canonical checkout and shared preview live at
`~/agent-workspace/executor-next`, on `main`. Keep it clean and synchronized with
`origin/main`. The old `sdk-scaffold` rift is not the shared preview or a second
source of truth. Its active task branches must be finished through normal PRs.

Before work, run `bun run workspace:check` in the canonical checkout. The check
fetches origin and reports the branch, dirty files, and divergence. It never
stashes, resets, switches branches, or changes worktree files. Resolve any
reported work before starting another task; never discard it to pass the check.

Each implementation task or agent gets its own short-lived rift and named
branch, created from current main. Run `bun run workspace:check --task` there
before editing. Use that rift for the whole task; do not mix another agent's
edits into it. Give task previews separate ports and scratch data.

Commit coherent pieces of authorized task work before starting a different task.
Unfinished work stays on a named branch with an explicit owner and status.
A task handoff must name its checkout, branch, commit or PR, checks, and remaining
uncommitted files. Do not leave work only in a dirty shared preview.

A merge is complete only after verifying the remote result and fast-forwarding
the clean canonical checkout to it. Run `bun run workspace:check` again. If the
preview has local edits, preserve and identify them; report the sync as blocked
instead of resetting or calling the preview current. Keep active task rifts
unchanged until their owners reconcile with the merged main.

Develop locally and keep secrets in 1Password. Publishing, merging, deployment,
and deferred features still require the user's authorization. This workflow
permits local commits for an authorized implementation task; it does not grant
blanket merge or deployment permission.

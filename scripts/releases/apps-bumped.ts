/**
 * Fail a pull request that changes the `apps` package without bumping its version. Merging to
 * `main` allocates the version and the deploy publishes it, so two different packages must never
 * carry the same version, even before either is on npm.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/releases/apps-bumped.ts <base staged directory>` after `bun run apps:build`
 * in both this checkout and the base checkout. Both are packed without scripts and compared file
 * by file; npm packs the same tree identically in any checkout.

 * A provider `health` check for an MCP server. Pass the check context `health` receives, then the
 * server's `url` and the `headers` that send the account's credentials:
 * `health: (check) => mcpHealth(check, { url, headers: headers(check.account) })`.
 *
 * It connects with those headers, initializes, and reads the first page of tools, then does the
 * same without any headers. No tool runs. The check passes only when the server accepts the account
 * and refuses the attempt without credentials. A refused account throws `ProviderError`, as HTTP
 * helpers do. An unreachable or unusable server throws `McpError`, and a request Executor's network
 * refuses throws `NetworkRefused`. A server that also answers without credentials, or whose answer
 * to that attempt is not a refusal, throws `McpCredentialsUnverified`. Each of these errors means
 * the check could not verify the account, and the account form explains why. Send credentials only
 * in `headers`; the attempt without them uses the same `url`. The check context's `signal` cancels
 * both attempts, and they share one budget that ends early enough before its `deadline` to report a
 * server that did not answer in time. `timeoutMs` can only shorten that budget.

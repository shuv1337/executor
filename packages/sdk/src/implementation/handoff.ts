/**
 * A one-time result that fibers of other requests may wait for.

 * there keeps running in that request's I/O context: its own RPC stubs, sockets and streams then
 * fail with "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request", and the I/O it starts is
 * cancelled when that request ends. A handoff settles a native promise instead. The runtime runs
 * each waiter's continuation in the request that registered it.

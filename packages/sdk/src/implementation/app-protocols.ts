 *
 * Their calls carry no kind: the bundle derives it from the tool's prefix. The host still chooses
 * storage from the caller's kind, so a call whose kind disagrees with its prefix fails here
 * instead of running in the wrong mode. Inspection answers with a plain list of tools, which
 * becomes a catalog without routers. Workflow steps name an operation within its kind's catalog,
 * so the host prefixes the name to get the tool.
 *
 * What each added over the one before needs no conversion. Protocol 2's skill catalog reply may
 * say whether its loader read through the app cache; protocol 1 never does, which reads as a
 * loader that did not. Protocol 3's failures may carry the app's error detail; earlier failures
 * are the same failures without it, and earlier bundles ignore the detail in workflow step replies.

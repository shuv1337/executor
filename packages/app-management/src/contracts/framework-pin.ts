 * - `current`: main holds the running source.
 * - `behind`: main holds exactly the source of an earlier deployment that the running one
 *   replaced, as a direct file deploy leaves it. The pin commit saves the running source with the
 *   pin, so the next deploy from main keeps what runs today.
 * - `unpublished`: main has moved on from the running source, which is in its recent history.
 * - `diverged`: main and the running source each have changes the other lacks, or the running
 *   source is outside main's recent history.
 * - `undeployed`: nothing runs yet.
 *
 * Report mode names the pin it would make (`pin`, `pin-behind`, ...); apply mode names the pin it
 * committed (`pinned`, `pinned-behind`, ...). Other outcomes:
 * - `declared`: the working source (or, when behind, the running source) declares `dependencies.apps`.
 * - `invalid-manifest`: `package.json` is not a JSON object with object `dependencies`.
 * - `conflict`: the working source changed while this app was being pinned. Retried.
 * - `failed`: storage or Git failed for this app; other apps continue. Retried.
 * - `removed`: the app was deleted before it could be handled.

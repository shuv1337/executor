## Remote MCP tools

Import `mcpOperations` from `apps/mcp`. Add `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (currently
`1.30.0`) to the app's `package.json` dependencies. Custom Add generates this
manifest and the app/provider source. A public server needs no account:

```ts
import { defineApp } from "apps";
import { mcpOperations } from "apps/mcp";

export default defineApp({ accounts: {} }, async ({ signal }) => ({
  ...(await mcpOperations({
    url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
    ...(signal === undefined ? {} : { signal }),
  })),
}));
```

Authenticated templates declare `service: provider.many()` and combine discovery
with `accountOperations(accounts.service, account => mcpOperations({ ... }), { signal })`
from `apps`. Each tool takes `{ accountId, input }`: the chosen account ID and the
original upstream input. Same-name tools keep one name with an input schema for
each account. Empty selections expose no tools.

Pass headers derived from that callback's account.
OAuth uses `oauth2({ discover: "https://example.com/mcp" })`
and `Authorization: "Bearer " + account.fields.access_token`.
API-key methods use their declared fields and the server's required headers.
The factory runs with each configured app's selected account, so different
accounts can expose different catalogs. Do not keep a global authenticated catalog.

Streamable HTTP and legacy SSE are supported. Every discovery/call owns and
closes its connection. Session-local workflows do not survive separate tool
calls. Results retain MCP `content`, `structuredContent`, `isError`, and `_meta`;
remote tool failures are results, while transport failures reject the call.
Calls are never automatically retried. Upstream form elicitation automatically
uses the running tool context; preserve that context when wrapping generated tools.
Request and response metadata, including approval persistence choices, pass through.
Show approval terms from request metadata to the user. Return a persistence choice
only when the user explicitly selects it; accepting once must not add a saved grant.
Input waits pause the active upstream timeout; the server can impose its own deadline.
Discovery cannot prompt. Remote prompts/resources, sampling and URL-mode elicitation
are not exposed. Stdio uses the separate helper below.

## Local stdio MCP tools

Import `stdioOperations` from `apps/mcp/stdio` and declare
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in the app's dependencies. The local product's
**Custom app → MCP → Local process (stdio)** generates `index.ts`, an optional
`provider.ts`, and `package.json`. The HTTP helper never imports this process adapter.

Declare environment variable names in the form. The generated provider stores
their values as accounts and passes the chosen `account.fields` to the child.
The generated app uses `provider.many()` and `accountOperations`, as above.
Do not embed tokens in source, command arguments, or working-directory paths.
Servers with no environment fields need no account.

The helper discovers tools with the selected account and starts a
fresh initialized process for each discovery and call. It validates schemas,
retains MCP result semantics, forwards cancellation, and closes the process
on completion, error, or timeout. Arguments are literal; there is no shell.
The process receives the MCP SDK's basic inherited environment plus the
selected fields, not the host's full environment. Stderr is ignored. Edit the
source for server-specific behavior; this template does not retain sessions
across calls. Process spawning requires a host that provides it, such as the
local Node runtime.

## GraphQL and OpenAPI helpers

Use `graphqlOperations` from `apps/graphql` with the endpoint, selected account's
headers, and optional cancellation signal. Declare `graphql` (currently
`16.11.0`) in the app's dependencies.

Use `openapiOperations` from `apps/openapi` with the generated `operations.json`,
authentication metadata, and selected account. Custom Add generates these
files from a specification. The runtime helper accepts normalized operations,
not a raw specification, and needs no extra dependency. Swagger builds requests
from retained per-operation declarations. It does not download the spec per call.
Use `contentType` to choose an alternate declared request media type. Binary
request bodies and multipart binary fields take base64 strings. Binary responses
return `{ base64, contentType }`; text and NDJSON return text. Success responses
have a 16 MiB / 30-second read bound. Live SSE requires an authored subscription.
Old imports must be regenerated before rebuilding with the new helper.

OpenAPI imports retain documented errors with an exact HTTP status, a required
literal `_tag`, and either a declared string `message` or a schema description.
Local component references and plain `anyOf` alternatives are supported. A matching JSON failure returns its
code, status, and message in MCP's `execution.error.response`. The message comes
from the validated response field, or static documentation when the declaration
has no message field. Messages are limited to 4,096 characters. A body `recovery`
object with non-empty `action` and `instructions` strings is also returned as
`response.recovery`, and `error.message` ends with `Recovery: <action>`. A missing
or malformed `recovery` is ignored. Other payload fields, headers, and stacks are
not forwarded.
Authentication and rate limits keep their existing provider-error handling.
Unknown, malformed, oversized, or stalled error bodies use the generic failure.

Inside an `execute` program's `catch`, CodeMode exposes only `error.message`.
For these declared API errors it contains JSON with `code`, `status`,
`message`, and an optional `recovery`; parse it with `JSON.parse`. Other failures are ordinary diagnostic
strings, so guard that parse. A failed mutation may already have made changes;
inspect its state before retrying. Existing imports need regenerated metadata
and a new deployment to gain this behavior.

Authenticated GraphQL and OpenAPI templates also use `provider.many()` and
`accountOperations`. Public templates keep their original tool inputs and need
no account selection. Existing apps change only when their source is edited and
deployed again.

Helpers are separate subpath imports. Importing `apps` alone does not load
MCP or GraphQL. Optional dependencies must appear in the app's manifest and
resolve from its own installation. A missing peer fails the deployment with
the package to add. A declared `apps` version owns its framework dependencies;
otherwise the host supplies them.

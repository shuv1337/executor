/**
 * Choose the E2E scenarios each CI job runs.
 *
 * Pushes to `main` and manual runs get the full suite. A pull request runs the spec files its
 * description names in one fenced `e2e` block, plus every spec file the pull request changes:
 *
 * ```e2e
 * groups.spec.ts
 * app-cache.spec.ts
 * ```
 *
 * The block may instead say `none`, or `all` followed by the reason the change needs every
 * scenario. A pull request without the block fails selection, so every run is a deliberate choice.
 * So does a name these jobs would not run: one that is not a spec file in e2e/tests/, or one that
 * another `e2e/*.config.ts` runs, which the failure names with the workflow that runs it.
 * Each job receives a `--test-name` pattern, or an empty output when none of its scenarios is
 * selected; the job is then skipped.
 *
 * The block may also say `skip` on the lower layer of a stack: another open pull request must
 * build on its branch. Every check then skips, and the layer above tests the combined change.
 *
 * The description is read when the job runs. `gh stack submit` opens each pull request before
 * its author writes the description, and opens a stack's layers one at a time, so the job waits
 * a few minutes for an e2e block, and for a pull request above a `skip` layer, before it fails.
 *
 * A scenario that guards a dependency patch also runs whenever the pull request's tree pins that
 * dependency or its patch differently from main, whatever the block says. So does a scenario that
 * guards a file stating a whole contract, such as the host's app protocols, when that file differs.
 * A changed spec file's Cloud scenarios that would otherwise first run on deployed Cloud after
 * merge run in the `cloud-product` job when managed local Cloud can run them, and are reported otherwise.
 *
 * Every run also checks that each scenario the plan schedules runs in CI, in a job here or in
 * Cloud tests on main, unless notRunInCi says why it cannot. That check reads only the job table
 * here. `node e2e/ci-selection.ts verify <ci|deployed> <directory>` checks after a full run that
 * those scenarios did execute, from the reports the jobs saved, so a workflow that stops running
 * one fails on main.
